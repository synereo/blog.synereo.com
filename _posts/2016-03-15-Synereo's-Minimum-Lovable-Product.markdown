It’s been close to a year since our original crowdsale, and more than a year and a half since we first envisioned Synereo and started laying down the foundations for its creation. While the contributions during the sale were generous and numerous, they summed up to a number that’s at the low end of what’s required for a project at this scale.

Tightening our belts and cutting corners wherever possible, we made it through, and are proud to present a first glimpse into the fully decentralized and distributed social networking application we’re about to release.

Upon release, users will be able to post messages and pictures, like and share, post comments, create and assign tags, **and [Amplify](http://blog.synereo.com/2015/03/27/how-amps-work/) content** -- among other things we’ll leave to you to discover.

All of the functionality on the network is handled by the user-powered “decentralized cloud”, based on our SpecialK tech stack and social contracting layer, hosted, routed and verified by real people hosting Synereo nodes on their machines and compensated with AMPs for their contribution to the network.<BR>

**Here’s the word from our Product/UX team:**

This initial prototype for a basic Synereo social networking experience leads with a clean and modern container for an evolving canvas employing well understood interaction patterns and a light Synereo look and feel. We have tons of fun ideas queued up to layer onto this initial canvas!

Check out this deck for an overview of our design thinking for this first prototype, how to move around the clickthrough, and what’s coming next.

We're excited to be able to share further in future prototypes where we will be looking for user research feedback on more specific user interactions. For now, enjoy!<BR>
