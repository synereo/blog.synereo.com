##[Detailed notes]

###[03:00 ---Technical Dev](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=3m1s) <br>
Greg Begins with the Technical Devs. He talks about the DVI version (downloadable) and some concepts about building the HTTP bridge and supporting a new non 2Factor for user creation. Dor, Gary & Eric are forming a dev team to push new version of deployment. Anybody interested in joining the devs team there are AMPs available. In addition to the Casper front, the dev group is trying to get a HASH, and what the stake in the system will be next vs betting on BLOCKS. If those strategies could be combined. Using blocks the problem is that the confirmation times for transactions spends a lot of time. Another problem, you can’t potentially have validators that are built on stake groups that are inconsistent with betting on Blocks. Also, instead of betting in stake groups or Blocks, other options like properties that define group of blocks, etc (which logic has been written during the weekend) have been taking into account.

[09:30 ---UI Updates](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=9m30s) <br>
Eric Talks about the connectivity between the UI and the server. Post creation is checked and the next steps are the contract creation and aggregation of the wallet. He shows an example of the responsive UI and some good properties of the built system.  Also tells us about some improving server processes, friend invitations and other issues. He speaks  about continuous working on marketing and market research like interviews and freelancers.

[12:45 ---Agenda and Canvas - Dor](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=12m45s) <br>
Developers are needed, We have funds not only to pay with AMPs, but with FIAT$ as well. Then he talks about going to NY for some important agenda. They are going to meet with Filippi who could help us to create a decentralized model for Synereo. In the next point, Dor explains that we are studying possibilities for the distributed community government and that those experiments are made in the” Loomio”, which is a deliberative web application. Granting in this way, that decisions can be made by community members.

He also has designed the basic canvas (pretty beautiful) and explains how it is distributed, with a main clear feed where attention is focused . On the left we would have the map of the network where contents would be amplified; and remarking that you have total control of the information shared with anyone.  Greg joins in to explain what roll makes the social contracts, and their importance.  He also tell us about how the Smart interaction with the content happens, and how you can empower it with the rest of the network and the role of reputation. Greg talks about the needing of a presentation, where one of the main points is the attention, and explaining that having this clear, algorithms could work in that way and would focus better on the priorities. After that, Eric and Greg discuss the economy of attention and their interaction as well as the prioritization  when multiple feeds are involved.

[37:30 ---Testing and Privacy](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=37m30s) <br>
Alan starts telling us about the testing process, explaining that is being working in an A-B testing model and notes an analyst platform. That is where anything can be added and tested and is coordinated by a node (not by a centralized server) trying to get an environment where all can be optimized. Dor tells him that the job is being done with the UXP on the platform.

Ryan and Greg remark the importance that Synereo will keep the privacy of the users and their data. It’s a very important point that should concern everyone and the Synereo team is working for the maximum success of protecting users. One of the tools to reach this is called a “social contract”, which is being developed. Eric and Alan explain their points.

[30:54 ---BnkToTheFuture Campaign and Market Price](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=30m54s) <br>
<br>![image]()<br> 
Dor comments on the recent interest in cryptocoins growing due to the price increase. The possibility that selling AMPs to be used as funding, increasing in that way the waves of interest in cryptocoins, is being studied. After that he talks about the BnkToTheFuture Campaign for those who invest having equity. The decisions have to be made. 
Jonny joins the conversation explaining that he thinks that BnkToTheFuture could be used in conjunction with other methods of raising capital, he says that one of Synereo’s strengths is as a framework layer, on which many apps can leverage Synereo’s tools,  creating a whole ecosystem of DAPPS which can all benefit from Synereo’s fundraising goals.
.
Market Price –
Dor asks for opinions for a way to fix the possibility of market manipulation. Maybe with a fixed price, or other solutions like an average method. All this relates to the crowdsale, and getting a fair price. Several opinions are given, and Greg speaks about a discount for equity holders,  due to investors being the ones who are holding the risk

[47:55 ---Governance](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=47m55s) <br>
The first approximation is that the community will have a voice without knowing the details of input right now while Synereo still isn’t deployed. This was discussed with all the community leaders and a creation of a separate Loomio for all the community members.  For now the structure would be the directors, community leaders, the designers and a general section for the public. Jonny tell his thoughts about how to re-engage the structure relative to the holders, but Greg remarks that today all the decisions are determined by the community (not the directors, nor investors.. ) and gives the example of the crowdsale and the commitments with BnkToTheFuture. Greg also reminds everyone that there videos, guides, etc are being made; whatever is needed to make the process clear and ensure that the whole community feels the same way. Jonny also suggests a marketing campaign towards the next crowdsale. Jonny, Greg and Eric speak about resource management and the importance of letting people know what they are for, and how they are used. Greg says we are today in the position of wisely spending  resources, and Jonny suggests organizing them to give them a quick and structured  approach of what is needed. Alan suggests some kind of constitution and Greg, building from this, talks about a place where all the possible people could get together and reach consensus.
