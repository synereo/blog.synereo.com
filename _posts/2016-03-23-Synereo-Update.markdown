### March 23, 2016 Synereo Community Hangout

## Update Summary

This week, the team covered several improvements made towards all of our efforts. Greg discusses some Casper issues, and specifically betting cycles, comparing betting on STAKE vs. on BLOCKS. With the new proposal, transaction rates for the new Proof of Stake Blockchain are dramatically increased, while confirmation times are dramatically lowered. 

We were able to see how the UI is currently taking shape. Additional insight into the specifications for the BnkTotheFuture crowdsale was shared. Finally, Community Leaders and their governance systems were discussed.

## Detailed notes

## [03:00 ---Technical Dev](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=3m1s) <br>

Greg Begins with the Technical Devs. He talks about the DVI version (downloadable) and some concepts about building the HTTP bridge and supporting a new non 2-Factor for user creation. Dor, Gary & Eric are forming a DevOps team to push new version of deployment. Anybody interested in joining the DevOps team there are AMPs available. 

In the Casper front, validators are not actually proposing and verifying blocks, but whole sets of blocks described by properties they communicate to each other during the consensus resolution phase of the protocol. When the validators have come to consensus, they have come to consensus on a maximally consistent subset of properties, or the largest set of blocks they can all agree is valid. Thus, transaction rates are dramatically increased, while confirmation times are dramatically lowered.


## [09:30 ---UI Updates](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=9m30s) <br>

Eric Talks about the connectivity between the UI and the server. Post creation is checked and the next steps are the contract creation and aggregation of the wallet. He shows an example of the responsive UI and some good properties of the built system.  Also tells us about some improving server processes, friend invitations and other issues. He speaks about continuous work on market research.

## [12:45 ---Agenda and Canvas - Dor](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=12m45s) <br>

Developers are needed! We have funds not only to pay with AMPs, but with FIAT$ as well. Dor mentions the meeting with Primavera de Fillipi in the NYC Blockchain Workshop conference, helping Synereo create a governance model. He explains that we are studying possibilities for distributed community governance and that some experiments are already being made in Loomio, which is a deliberative web application. 

Dor discusses some refinements he suggested and that have been designed for the basic UI canvas and explains how content in the stream received greater emphasis and focus when being attended. Another new element he proposed is shown, on the left of each content piece, presenting a map of the network the piece traveled to and how it got to your stream. 

Greg joins in to explain what role social contracts play there, and their importance.  He also tell us about how the smart interaction with the content happens, and how you can empower it with the rest of the network and the role of reputation in that. After that, Eric and Greg discuss the economy of attention and their interaction as well as the prioritization  when multiple feeds are involved.

## [37:30 ---Testing and Privacy](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=37m30s) <br>

Alan tells us about the testing process, explaining that is being working in an A-B testing model and notes an analyst platform. That is where anything can be added and tested and is coordinated by a node (not by a centralized server) trying to get an environment where all can be optimized. Dor tells him that the job is being done with the UXPin on the platform.

Ryan and Greg remark the importance that Synereo will keep the privacy of the users and their data. It’s a very important point that should concern everyone and the Synereo team is working for the maximum success of protecting users. One of the tools to reach this is called a “social contract”, which is being developed. Eric and Alan explain their points.

## [30:54 ---BnkToTheFuture Campaign and Market Price](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=30m54s) <br>

Dor comments on the recent interest in cryptocoins growing due to the price increase in many coins. The possibility that selling AMPs to be used as funding, increasing in that way the waves of interest in cryptocoins, is being studied. After that he talks about the BnkToTheFuture Campaign for those who invest having equity. The decisions have to be made. 
Jonny joins the conversation explaining that he thinks that BnkToTheFuture could be used in conjunction with other methods of raising capital, he says that one of Synereo’s strengths is as a framework layer, on which many apps can leverage Synereo’s tools,  creating a whole ecosystem of DAPPs which can all benefit from Synereo’s fundraising goals.

Market Price –
Dor asks for opinions for a way to fix the possibility of market manipulation. Maybe with a fixed price, or other solutions like an average method. All this relates to the crowdsale, and getting a fair price. 

## [47:55 ---Governance](https://youtu.be/fsQc_8Bn2vo?t=47m55s) <br>

The first approximation is that the community will have a voice without knowing the details of input right now while Synereo still isn’t deployed. This was discussed with all the community leaders and a creation of a separate Loomio for all the community members.  For now the structure would be the directors, community leaders, the designers and a general section for the public. Jonny tell his thoughts about how to re-engage the structure relative to the holders, but Greg remarks that today all the decisions are determined by the community (not the directors, nor investors.. ) and gives the example of the crowdsale and the commitments with BnkToTheFuture. Greg also reminds everyone that there are videos, guides, etc are being made; whatever is needed to make the process clear and ensure that the whole community feels the same way. Jonny also suggests a marketing campaign towards the next crowdsale. Jonny, Greg and Eric speak about resource management and the importance of letting people know what they are for, and how they are used. Greg says we are today in the position of wisely spending resources, and Jonny suggests organizing them to give them a quick and structured approach of what is needed. Alan suggests some kind of constitution and Greg, building from this, talks about a place where all the possible people could get together and reach consensus.
