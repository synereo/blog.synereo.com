### March 2, 2016 Synereo Community Hangout

**This week we saw a demonstration of messages being sent between two different applications running on the Synereo platform**. We now have three open source applications that developers can use as templates from which to bootstrap their own decentralized autonomous apps: LivelyGig, Splicious, and the Synereo Social Networking application.

### [02:24 --- Governance](https://youtu.be/2AuXvWjy6T8?t=2m24s)

Community members are making use of Jisti Meet for impromtu video conferencing outside of the regularly scheduled Wednesday Hangouts. We are collaborating on tasks and fielding some of the questions coming in from the interested public. There was some discussion about reputation based voting within the community as we work on tasks and collect bounties. HJ shared some spreadsheets, and Greg described the process by which the project's founders worked out their equity stakes.

This led to the topic of Reputation Systems. Greg is bringing together a satellite meeting during this April's [COALA](http://coala.global) conference regarding the "Reputation of Reputations". Synereo, as well as groups like [backfeed](http://magazine.backfeed.cc/the-backfeed-protocol-an-introduction-for-mere-mortals/) are working to formalize blockchain based reputation systems which have the potential to exercise authority outside the jurisdiction of existing laws and authorities. We need help from regulators to design these systems to include Mercy (humanity), and not to be based on the wisdom of the mob.[^2]

### [24:01 --- Casper](https://youtu.be/2AuXvWjy6T8?t=24m01s)
Greg reports that considerable technical progress is being made regarding Ethereum's Casper Proof of Stake Protocol. The weekly 'Standup' meetings are being conducted over Google Hangouts and are available for viewing on YouTube. By adopting a similar level of transparency as Synereo, they are practicing _accountability through visibility_. Participants each report on their individual progress and together work towards the project's goals.

### [33:43 --- Dor's Updates](https://youtu.be/2AuXvWjy6T8?t=33m43s)
Interviews for the Marketing Leader position are coming along, and a hiring decision will be made within a month. Participation in the Israeli EISP 'Accelerator' program has yielded high level contacts for advice, mentorship, and investment. Dor mentions one mentor, [Gal Nachum](https://il.linkedin.com/in/galnachum), a highly known 5X entrepreneur with vast experience now brought to bear for Synereo. 

HJ is creating a 'onboarding portal' to help bring newly interested community participants up to speed about what we are up to at Synereo and how they can help. Translation projects are underway for Spanish and soon, Mandarin. Eric, Dina, and Noy are working on the visual design of the updated Synereo App in preparation for a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) launch. A second developer from Nirvanic is being hired by Synereo and should start March 7, the first one has been working on LivelyGig's front end (webapp).

### [48:00 --- LivelyGig Updates](https://youtu.be/2AuXvWjy6T8?t=48m00s)
Ed demonstrates how different applications using the Synereo Platform are able to communicate with one another. He creates a label in the Splicious app and then shows how that label appears in LivelyGig. Next will come the ability to search all posts matching that label. Besides this great progress with the user interface, he continues to develop the contract and escrow models for the marketplace.

Greg says that the next build of the Synereo server is under development with help from Gary, and should be available by March 16. He clarifies that the contract model for the Synereo Social Network will work differently than that of LivelyGig because every post is tied to AMP and Reo.

Greg gives a shout out to the [League of Crafty Guitarists](http://thelcg.net/), who after 30 years of performing around the world, are in their final year. Through their example of self assembly and self governance, the Guitar Circle / Guitar Craft communities have provided much of the inspiration for the Synereo project.<br>
